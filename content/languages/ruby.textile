h2. Language Versions

There are many versions of Ruby. When you're starting out, it's best to stick to the latest "MRI" 1.9 version (1.9.3 at the time of writing).  
By doing so you'll learn the latest Ruby techniques and avoid compatibility issues which can be difficult to pinpoint and fix. You can then explore other versions as you want or need.

h3. Ruby Version Management

Rubyists have developed tools to improve the process of installing Ruby and switching between versions. There are some differences between the tools, but at the end of the day they allow you to:

* Change the global Ruby version
* Specify the Ruby version per-project
* Install Ruby

The two main tools are "rvm":https://rvm.io//rvm/install/ and "rbenv":https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv / "ruby-build":https://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build. Both have very good documentation.

h3. MRI

MRI means "Matz Ruby Interpreter". It's the official version of the language.  'Matz' refers to Yukihiro Matsumoto, the creator of Ruby.

h4. 1.8

There are still some libraries that are only compatible with Ruby 1.8. If you have to use 1.8, you should use 1.8.7

h4. 1.9

h4. 2.0

Not yet released

h3. JRuby

h2. Debugging

"Ruby Debug in 30 Seconds":http://pivotallabs.com/users/chad/blog/articles/366-ruby-debug-in-30-seconds-we-don-t-need-no-stinkin-gui

Use "ruby-debug" with MRI 1.8 and "ruby-debug19" in MRI 1.9 .

h3. Dependency Management

"Bundler":http://gembundler.com/v1.1/index.html is the canonical tool for managing Ruby gem dependencies. Before bundler, it was difficult to specify exactly which versions of a gem should be used and to ensure that the gems you load wouldn't load a conflicting gem. If you ever run into a problem where Ruby throws an error along the lines of, "can't activate activerecord (= 2.0.2), already activated activerecord-1.15.3", then Bundler will help you solve that problem.
